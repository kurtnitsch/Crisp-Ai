A lightweight, scalable AI-to-AI communication protocol for secure, ethical, and collaborative Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Crisp enables millions of AI nodes to sync trillions of knowledge entries in real-time.

## Features
- Scalable: Trillion-entry SKC with sharded partitions (Type 0x6B).
- Real-Time: Sub-millisecond sync (Type 0x6D).
- Ethical: Alignment checks (Type 0x6E).
- Interoperable: ROS/TensorFlow adapters (Type 0x6F).
